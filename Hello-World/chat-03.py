    Q: Write a function to check if a number is a palindrome.

    Letâ€™s think step by step.

    Step 1: Understand what a palindrome is. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward (e.g., 121 or 909).

    Step 2: Convert the number to a string.

    Step 3: Compare the string with its reverse.

    Step 4: Return True if they match, else return False.

    Answer (in Python):
    def is_palindrome(n):
    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]
